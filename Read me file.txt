- `QuizQuestion.cs`: Quiz question data structure

## Customization

To modify the application:

1. **Responses**: Edit the `InitializeResponses()` method in `ChatBot_AI.cs` to change cybersecurity information
2. **Quiz Questions**: Modify the `InitializeQuizQuestions()` method to add/change questions
3. **UI**: Adjust the XAML files for visual changes
4. **Audio**: Replace `greeting.wav` with a custom audio file
